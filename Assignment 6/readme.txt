3. I have commented out a line of the getHeight function that 
works as the test. It simply prints out the value of the counter
variable tracking the distance of the node that we're looking for from
the root node at each iteration of the loop that looks for our target 
value. Since we increment this counter each time we move to a new node,
this lets us check the distance as the function runs.
